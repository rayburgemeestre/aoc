For this challenge I decided to learn golang (from scratch)

The code may not always be the most idiomatic go code, but hopefully as the challenges progress the code improves as well.

In case I used go for challenges I will also commit the binaries, they should be runnable on a linux 64bit distribution.

Some "peers" found :)
